# Blackbody Radiation Visualiser

> Interactive astrophysics tool combining Python modelling and web-based visualisation.

## What this project does

This project shows how the radiation curve of a star changes with temperature.

Users can explore:

- Planck curve shape
- peak wavelength
- Wien’s displacement law
- approximate stellar colour trend
- visible wavelength range

## Visual Understanding

### Blackbody Radiation Curves

</p>

These curves show how the intensity and peak wavelength change with temperature.
Hotter objects emit more energy and peak at shorter wavelengths.

### Wien’s Law (Peak Shift)

</p>

As temperature increases, the peak wavelength shifts toward shorter (bluer) wavelengths.

### Stellar Temperature and Colour

</p>

Stars appear red, yellow, or blue depending on their surface temperature.

### Electromagnetic Spectrum Context

The visible spectrum is only a small part of the full emission range.

## Physics background

A blackbody emits radiation across a continuous range of wavelengths. The peak wavelength depends on temperature:

λmax = b / T

where:

- λ_max = peak wavelength
- T = temperature (K)
- b = 2.898 × 10⁻³ m·K

As temperature increases, the peak shifts towards shorter wavelengths.

## Why this matters

Blackbody radiation is important in:

- stellar astrophysics
- exoplanet science
- spectroscopy
- thermal physics
- radiation laws
- observational astronomy
